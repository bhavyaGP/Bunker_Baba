Hello Everyone !!
Run the project using these commands.

Follow these steps if youâ€™re working with Vite and React for the first time.

Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

   	1. Download Node.js (which includes npm) from nodejs.org.
	2. Choose the LTS version for better stability.
	3. Follow the installation instructions for your OS.
	4. Verify the installation:
          	node -v
          	npm -v
   	
This should display the versions of Node.js and npm installed.

Step 2: Navigate to the project directory:
<br>
 `cd bunkerbaba`

Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

Now, install the dependencies for the client and server (if you plan to add a server)<br>
        `cd client` <br>
        `npm install`

Step 4: Run Your Vite + React Project

To ensure everything is working, run the development server.<br>
       `cd client`<br>
        `npm run dev`
